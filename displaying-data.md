# Writing our first React Test - Displaying Data

As we learned in [Advanced TDD with Go](https://github.com/bjssacademy/advanced-tdd), the best way to write a test before code is to think of it as an executable specification.

We're going to write a basic React component to show us a Quote of the Day.

The basic specification is:

- Accepts a piece of text, the quote of the day
- Renders this quote as normal text
- Provides a heading above the quote

We can make some good-practice design decisions:

- The component will be called `<Quote />`
- The text will be passed as a property named `text`

To write our first test, we capture those decisions into test code.

We're using vitest syntax for this. This syntax is designed to be identical to the Jest test framework, as that is very widely known. Vitest integrates better with vite.

## Create the test file

Create a file `Quote.spec.jsx` with the following content:

```jsx
import * as React from "react";
import { render } from "@testing-library/react";

describe("Quote component", () => {
  it("renders heading text", () => {
    render(<Quote />);
  });
});
```

We're starting by adding only the _Arrange_ and _Act_ sections of our test.

- We've captured the intent in our messages that the `Quote component` `renders heading text`.
- `render(<Quote />);` will render our component html into the virtual DOM

We can run this partial test using

```bash
npm run -- --test
```

and we'll get a test failure:

![Test fail on render](images/quote-fails-render.png)

The error test confirms that we've asked a `<Quote />` component to render, but we do not have that component.

Let's add the React component file, and call it `Quote.jsx':

```jsx
const Quote = () => {};

export default Quote;
```

We need to import that into our test file:

```jsx
import * as React from "react";
import { render } from "@testing-library/react";

import Quote from "./Quote";

describe("Quote component", () => {
  it("renders heading text", () => {
    render(<Quote />);
  });
});
```

When we run the test using

```bash
npm run -- --test
```

The test passes. We have a Quote component available.

It's not the world's _best_ component, exactly. We need to make it actually do something.

## Rendering the header text

Following the requirements, our component needs to display some header text.

Let's take the approach of writing a weak test to get us started, then strengthening it later.

The weak version of test will confirm only that the correct text is displayed, nothing more.

Add the following to `Quote.spec.jsx`:

```jsx
import * as React from "react";
import { render, screen } from "@testing-library/react";

import Quote from "./Quote";

describe("Quote component", () => {
  it("renders heading text", () => {
    render(<Quote />);

    expect(screen.getByText("Quote of the Day")).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```

We run the test using

```bash
npm run -- --test
```

and as expected, the test fails, telling us that no such text can be found:

![Test fail - missing heading text](images/quote-fails-heading-text.png)

That's simple enought to fix. We add _just enough_ code to the component to make the test pass (and fulfil the slice of specification we are working on).

Add the following `return` value to `Quote.jsx`:

```jsx
const Quote = () => {
  return "Quote of the Day";
};

export default Quote;
```

Once we run the test again, it passes.

## Converting the text into a header

We've only specified part of what we need to do. There is no the correct text being displayed for our heading. But it isn't a heading.

The `screen` object allows us to define the kind of heading we want to find. We define it using the ARIA roles for accessibility.

In our test, we say we want to find something displayed with the ARIA role of `heading`. We would like that to be at `level 2`.

Let's add this level of detail into our existing test, to strengthen it:

```jsx
import * as React from "react";
import { render, screen } from "@testing-library/react";

import Quote from "./Quote";

describe("Quote component", () => {
  it("renders heading text", () => {
    render(<Quote />);

    expect(screen.getByRole("heading", { level: 2 })).toHaveTextContent(
      "Quote of the Day"
    );
  });
});
```

We are searching for something an ARIA reader would recognise as a heading, level 2. We then check that our desired heading text is present in that element.

Running the test will fail, as we do not have any such heading yet.

Let's add the heading html into our Component JSX:

```jsx
const Quote = () => {
  return <h2>Quote of the Day</h2>;
};

export default Quote;
```

Run the test. It passes.

## Passing in the quote as a property

Our final piece of work involves displaying the actual quotation itself. We took a design decision to pass in the quote text as a React property, called `text`.

Let's specify this in a new test, added to our `describe` block of `Quote.spec.jsx`:

```jsx
it("renders quotation passed in as property", () => {
  render(<Quote text="Truth eludes power" />);

  expect(screen.getByText("Truth eludes power")).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

We run that test and watch it fail. Ah, the very heartbeat of our misery.

Anyway, cheer up. We can add this React code into `Quote.jsx` to make it pass:

```jsx
const Quote = ({ text }) => {
  return (
    <>
      <h2>Quote of the Day</h2>
      <p>{text}</p>
    </>
  );
};

export default Quote;
```

You can find out more about why that exact code is needed over at [BJSS Academy React Basics](https://github.com/bjssacademy/react-basics)

The test will now pass.

## Visual inspection of the Quote component

With user interface work, it's always important to _actually look_ at what we're building.

Even using test-first TDD - or perhaps especially when using it - we must check layouts and conformance to visual design rules. TDD will help us develop components that we can trust to work. But the _Mark 1 Eyeball, Human_ remains the final arbiter of taste.

We had an `<App />` component generated for us by vite. Let's replace it's content with an example use of our shiny new Quote component.

In file `App.jsx`, replace the content with this:

```jsx
import "./App.css";
import Quote from "./Quote";

function App() {
  return <Quote text="Man walks into a bar. Ouch. It was an iron bar" />;
}

export default App;
```

We can run the vite server using the command line:

```bash
npm run dev
```

We need to follow the instuctions given on the terminal output to find the correct URL for our browser:

![Vite output](images/vite-server-output.png)

Navigating to this URL in Chrome shows us our `<Quote />` component in all its glory:

## Review

We have successfully test-driven a React component which displays data passed in as props.
